Address can be divided as follows:
Extended address
Page address
Offset (relative to page)
LSB bit (high/low byte of word)

All those parts of address have fixed bit length, that should be described in configuration file.


Target description is as follows:
* name
* flash size
* page size
* use extended address
* eeprom size
* eeprom page size
* use eeprom page access


Endpoint:
<header>
* task number (uint8_t). Non-zero!
* Flags:
*   0 - read
*   1 - write
*   2 - verify
*   3 - perform chip erase
*   4 - 
*   5 - 
*   6 - disable page write feature 
*   7 - do not check signature
* task status (enum)
* address start (uint32_t). MSB differs - flash or EEPROM
* payload size (uint16_t, up to 256)
</header>
* payload remaining to be transfered (uint16_t)
* payload (256 bytes)

task status can be:
* Empty = 0
(send header)
* Filling (Buffer claimed. Waiting for write)
(send multiple packets to fill buffer)
* Queued (Data received or not needed)
(programmer waits for completion of another task)
* Writing
(programmer sends data to mcu)
* Waiting (after write)
(programmer waits and polls mcu)
* Reading
(programmer reads data from mcu to verify/read)
* Buffer ready (waiting for read)
(master sends multiple read commands and then ACKs)
* Finished (with result code)
(master reads response code and then ACKs)
